# Auto Queue - League of Legends Queue Automation

Auto Queue is a simple Electron application that automatically accepts the queue in League of Legends. This project is built using Electron, and the installer will create an executable (`.exe`) to run the application.


## Installation

1. **Download and Install**: 
    - Download the installer from the [Releases](https://github.com/jerobas/lol-queue-app/releases) page.
    - Run the installer to install the application on your system.

2. **Copy DLL to System32**:
